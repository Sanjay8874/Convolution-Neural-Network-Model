# [Convolution Neural Network for Dog and Cats](https://github.com/sam2702/Convolution-Neural-Network-Model)
Model contains a basic recognizer using Keras Library with Tensorflow in backend.
### 
Here is a Simple CNN that achieves over **84% Accuracy of Training set and 75% Accuuracy of Test set.**
By adding _2nd Convolution layer_ we increase the **Accuracy of Training set over 85% and Test set 82%.**
## Steps

1.**Convolution2D Layer**

2.**MaxPooling2D Layer**

3.**Flatten Layer**

4.**Dense Layer**

5.**Compiling the CNN**

6.**Fitting the CNN to the images**
